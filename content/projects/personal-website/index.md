For a long time I was arguing with myself whether I need a
traditional WordPress (or any other backend-heavy) stack to serve
my website. Of course not. Static site generators like
<a class="text-link" href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and
<a class="text-link" href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> are
perfectly capable of delivering an often far superior user
experience. GitHub Actions allow me to keep the live site in sync with every push.
