An excellent coach (mediator, psychotherapist) needs an excellent web presence. That's why I chose Next.js backed by a
headless cms to build the website of my mother. Everytime something's changed in the cms a webhook signals the hosting
provider (<a class="text-link" href="http://vercel.com">Vercel</a>)
to rebuild the frontend.
